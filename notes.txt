1: 25/04/2020: Damn!! I can't code at night, anyway I tried to solve codeforces 700 question and inderstood the approach too but I have problem coding at night I feel sleepy.
                P.S: It's not even 11:00pm yet.
2: 28/04/2020: Taking very huge as input on int var = Scanner.nextInt() won't work (Input mismatch)
                I should be using long var = Scanner.nextLong()
3: 07/05/2020: I understimated the problem https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1230/A.... Solved in CPP
                Still Incomplete
4: 08/05/2020: Completed the last days problem: tip for Coding Questions if it is small then hardcode it 
                eg for last problem only 4 times iteration was required, hence used 4 loops
